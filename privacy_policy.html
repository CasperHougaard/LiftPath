    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: <span id="date"></span></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our Fitness Training App ("the App"). 
        This App is designed for users aged 18 years and older. We do not knowingly collect information 
        from children under 13 years of age.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Local Data Storage</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>All data is stored locally on your device only.</strong> The App does not transmit, 
        share, or synchronize any information to external servers or third-party services.
    </p>
    <p>The following information may be stored on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Workout Data:</strong> Exercise names, sets, weights, repetitions, dates, notes, and ratings</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise Library:</strong> Custom exercise names and categories you create</li>
        <li><strong>Training Sessions:</strong> Complete workout history including dates and all logged sets</li>
        <li><strong>App Settings:</strong> Rest timer preferences, progression settings, and user preferences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data is stored in a local JSON file on your device's internal storage and is only 
        accessible by the App itself.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Permissions and Usage</h2>
    <p>The App requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS:</strong> To display rest timer notifications during workouts. 
            Used to show countdown timers and completion alerts.</li>
        <li><strong>FOREGROUND_SERVICE / FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE:</strong> To run a rest timer 
            service that provides continuous countdown visible to users even when the app is in the 
            background. This ensures accurate timing between exercise sets.</li>
        <li><strong>VIBRATE:</strong> To provide haptic feedback when rest timer completes. 
            Enhances user experience by alerting users when rest period ends.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All permissions are used solely for the stated purposes and are not used to collect, 
        transmit, or share any personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We do not share, sell, or transmit any user data.</strong> Since all data is stored 
        locally on your device:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No data is sent to external servers</li>
        <li>No data is shared with third-party services</li>
        <li>No analytics or tracking services are used</li>
        <li>No advertising networks are integrated</li>
        <li>No cloud synchronization occurs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is stored in the App's private directory on your device, protected by Android's 
        app sandbox security model. Only the App itself can access this data. We recommend:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using device lock screen protection</li>
        <li>Regular device backups if you want to preserve your workout history</li>
        <li>Using the App's built-in export feature (if available) to create manual backups</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        Your workout data remains on your device until you:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete the App (which removes all stored data)</li>
        <li>Use the "Reset Data" feature within the App's Settings</li>
        <li>Clear the App's data through your device's system settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You have full control over your data. If you delete the App, all associated data is 
        permanently removed from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Age Restrictions</h2>
    <p>
        This App is designed for users aged 18 years and older. We do not knowingly collect 
        information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 18, please do not 
        use this App. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under 13, 
        we will delete that information immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>8. User Rights</h2>
    <p>As a user of this App, you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access all data stored by the App (visible within the App)</li>
        <li>Modify or delete any data at any time</li>
        <li>Export your data (if export feature is available)</li>
        <li>Delete all data by using the Reset Data feature or uninstalling the App</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this 
        page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes 
        acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
    </p>
